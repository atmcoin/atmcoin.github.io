								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I first saw mobile cash access in action in a demo at the 2011 ATMIA U.S. conference. It was pretty cool. No, way cool. Having previously written several mobile payments white papers for the ATM Marketplace sister publication, Mobile Payments Today, I was already enthused about that concept and couldn&#8217;t wait for it to catch on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting.</p>
<p>For some time, it seemed that mobile cash access would be slow out of the gate as well, more a nerd novelty than a standard practice. After all, a tiresomely pragmatic friend remarked when I described the ATMIA demo to him, &#8220;Why would I do that when I can just use my ATM card?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, there are several good reasons why, as Douglas Hartung, senior director of global software innovation at Diebold Nixdorf, explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Add those who plan to “in the near future” and the figure climbs to more than 50 per cent, signaling the potential threat of rivals including upstart financial technology firms to key business lines within Canada’s banks.</p>
<p>“To stay relevant, especially as financial technology companies, or fintechs, are taking a piece of the market, traditional banks need to build on their strengths — including brand, trust and community presence,” said Paul Battista, financial services advisory leader at EY, the global consultancy formerly known as Ernst &amp; Young.&#8221;</p>
