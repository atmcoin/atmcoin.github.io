								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I first saw mobile cash access in action in a demo at the 2011 ATMIA U.S. conference. It was pretty cool. No, way cool. Having previously written several mobile payments white papers for the ATM Marketplace sister publication, Mobile Payments Today, I was already enthused about that concept and couldn&#8217;t wait for it to catch on.</p>

<p>The problem is that the new terminals, with a few exceptions such as Square, aren’t plug-and-play. For merchants, the switchover means not just paying to replace their old stripe-swiping terminals and buying software to use with them, but also getting the terminal/software combination certified as functional with individual payment processors—a procedure that can take months.&#8221;</p>
