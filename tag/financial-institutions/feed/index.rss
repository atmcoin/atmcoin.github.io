								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Nearly one-third of Canadians have gone outside their banks in the past year for a financial services product or service, according to a new survey from EY.</p>
<div id="npAd1" class="ad" data-google-query-id="CPK2j5_d-88CFYcDPwod16MDTQ"></div>
<p>Add those who plan to “in the near future” and the figure climbs to more than 50 per cent, signaling the potential threat of rivals including upstart financial technology firms to key business lines within Canada’s banks.</p>
<p>“To stay relevant, especially as financial technology companies, or fintechs, are taking a piece of the market, traditional banks need to build on their strengths — including brand, trust and community presence,” said Paul Battista, financial services advisory leader at EY, the global consultancy formerly known as Ernst &amp; Young.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of card networks being hacked is become frighteningly common. Hacks, such as those that hit Target, Home Depot, and other big names, have prompted companies to add security features like chip readers into their POS devices. But that’s not the extent of the mischief, as this news story out of Taiwan illustrates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, July 10, 2016, hackers managed to infiltrate a network of bank ATMs belonging to Taiwan’s First Bank. According to reports, several people wearing masks accessed dozens of ATMs, spending just a few minutes with each machine and making off with the equivalent of $2 million in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators claimed that the machines were infected with three different malware files that instructed them to, in essence, “spit out cash” before deleting themselves from the software. This event has sent alarm bells through ATM manufacturers and owners, who now worry that their machines might also be at risk. Indeed, the number of ATMs compromised by criminals in the U.S. last year jumped 546%, according to FICO Card Alert Service.</span></p>
<h2><b>What makes for better security?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All ATMs run software specific to their brand. Just like any other networked computer, these machines can be targeted by hackers or infected with malware—although doing so is often much more difficult than with the average desktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heists like the Taiwan ATM event have prompted ATM owners to scan their machines for malware and decommission older machines that might be more susceptible to hacking. But, as with most things, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why security procedures like tokenization are become more widespread. With tokenization, secure “tokens” are stored in the secure element of a user’s phone or in a cloud-based HCE software vault. Only the two machines involved in the transaction can read these tokens, signaling that the data are being transferred to a legitimate machine (and so, hopefully, a legitimate customer.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other security features include pseudo-random cryptographically secure algorithms, time and location limits, and single-use codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Taiwan heist shows is that, once a new technology gains widespread adoption, criminals will try to exploit it for gain—but technology can also be the answer to such threats. With experience, app developers and financial institutions are learning to pay closer attention to security features to prevent criminals from exploiting technology loopholes.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money transfer has been a big business in recent years, with the remittance industry reporting more than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$436 billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in remittances in 2014 alone. Still, banks have been tightening up their rules for money transfers, making it harder and harder for small businesses to maintain their remittance business. Many are looking for technology solutions to get around those hurdles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remittance is, in the simplest terms, a money transfer from an individual in one country to an individual in another. Much of the growth of the remittance industry is being driven by people working abroad and sending money back to family and friends at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This industry is coming on to hard times as banks are growing more and more concerned about fraud and money laundering. Many banks have tightened their rules and security precautions; some are even flat out denying certain remittances, or closing accounts that initiate too many remittances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last category often includes small businesses that offer remittance services to the local population, particular if that population is “under-banked.” Even those businesses that do not face account closure are seeing tighter requirements: state licenses, hours of compliance training, and binders full of procedures and regulations to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue is that these businesses—often convenience stores, small shops, and the like—need an account into which they can deposit the cash from a remittance. But because it is nearly impossible for banks to know the identity of the final end-customer, remittance transactions are being categorized as a high risk for money laundering and denied banking services.</span></p>
<h2><b>Technology to the rescue for remittance?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remittance industry is slowly changing so as to overcome these limitations. In particular, mobile app developers and fintech companies are providing alternatives to traditional remittance models by offering more convenient and cheaper methods of sending remittances via mobile phones, part of the larger trend toward mobile money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International remittance using mobile money is proving to be full of opportunity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For customers who need to send money, mobile money provides a highly convenient, safe way to do so without the need to visit a physical location.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions are much more open to mobile money due to its security features. Sending and receiving remittances via mobile cash minimizes cash-handling risks and introduces a number of highly effective security features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money represents a huge market opportunity for financial institutions and payment partners that want to add to their services portfolio and reach many under-banked individuals.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, mobile technology eliminates the forms, codes, agents, extra time, and fees tied to the traditional money transfer process, making it much more appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important part of the “rise of mobile money” will be finding ways to integrate various services into one user interface. As the industry stands, some apps might handle mobile payments, but not ATM withdrawals from a physical machine. Or they might facilitate remittances without being able to handle POS transactions. Increasingly, though, both app providers and financial institutions are looking to “stay in front of the customer” by offering a single app that taps into a number of these features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what about the small businesses that traditionally served up remittances? They are retooling. Some chains, like 7-Eleven and Wawa, are offering their own apps for customers that want these services. Others are investing more heavily in ATMs and ATM services—with “mobile cash” capability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such business moves show that mobile money is more than a trend: It is rapidly becoming a mainstay of financial transactions for people of all income levels. Security and integration of apps will be the focus of the coming wave of technology, with early adopters capturing a large market share.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increased governmental regulation, low interest rates, and an increasingly competitive marketplace have placed enormous pressure on banks to raise revenue from their existing customer base, while reducing the cost to serve their customers. Furthermore, the evolution of digital banking channels and the emergence of new customer segments, i.e., millennials, has impacted traditional methods of servicing customers and building relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the summary findings of the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. This study, the 11th of its kind, measured customer satisfaction around six aspects of consumer banking: account information; channel activities; facility; fees; problem resolution; and product offerings. “Channel activities” included ratings of six separate channels for customer interaction: ATMs; branch offices; call centers; IVR; mobile apps; and banks’ websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A striking new finding in this study was that mobile banking appears to have had a direct impact on overall satisfaction. Overall satisfaction ratings were 27 points higher on average for customers who use mobile banking than among those who do not. The gap was even wider for those customer who were highly satisfied with their mobile experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the evolution and growth of mobile banking and payments, the demand for cash has remained study, and even has grown. Cash remains the most commonly used method of payment around the world, and 85% of Americans report that their use of cash has not dropped in recent years (according to a 2016 Mercator Advisory Group report.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings are not as squarely at odds as they first seem. Customers are demanding more flexibility and convenience from their bank, and high mobile adoption means they are willing to process transactions through their devices, if the app is intuitive and secure. But many transactions still involve a physical transfer of goods for cash. This means that customers are looking for ways in which their banking apps can be extended to safely access ATMs for withdrawals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ATMs are not going to leave the banking landscape anytime soon. While many pundits are predicting that mobile will “disrupt” or “eclipse” ATM use, the data tell a different story. A 2014 study from Visa found that more than half of respondents (57%) claimed that ATM convenience was their primary reason for choosing a financial institution. For the remaining 43%, many said it was the close second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more likely scenario, then, is that mobile offerings and ATMs will merge in the future to create a part-digital, part-physical integrated network. Until that happens, there is a looming market opportunity to collect more fees and drive customer satisfaction even higher.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The secret service has issued a warning to banks and ATM companies about a new way that thieves can steal your credit card information. A report from <em>Krebs</em> <em>on Security</em> explains that &#8220;periscope&#8221; skimmers have been found inside teller machines in Connecticut and Pennsylvania in the last two months. Of course, since the devices attach to the internal mechanism, there&#8217;s absolutely no way for an end user to tell if they&#8217;re at risk.&#8221;</p>
