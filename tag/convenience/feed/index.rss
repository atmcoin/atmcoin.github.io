								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I first saw mobile cash access in action in a demo at the 2011 ATMIA U.S. conference. It was pretty cool. No, way cool. Having previously written several mobile payments white papers for the ATM Marketplace sister publication, Mobile Payments Today, I was already enthused about that concept and couldn&#8217;t wait for it to catch on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting.</p>
<p>For some time, it seemed that mobile cash access would be slow out of the gate as well, more a nerd novelty than a standard practice. After all, a tiresomely pragmatic friend remarked when I described the ATMIA demo to him, &#8220;Why would I do that when I can just use my ATM card?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, there are several good reasons why, as Douglas Hartung, senior director of global software innovation at Diebold Nixdorf, explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>The problem is that the new terminals, with a few exceptions such as Square, aren’t plug-and-play.
